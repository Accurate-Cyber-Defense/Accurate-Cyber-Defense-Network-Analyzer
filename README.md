# Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Network-Analyzer
Accurate Cyber Defense Network Analyzer is a powerful and precise cybersecurity tool designed for network traffic analysis and penetration testing. 
It enables cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and network administrators to deeply inspect, analyze, and dissect network packets with high accuracy and performance. 

This tool is ideal for identifying vulnerabilities, understanding packet behavior, and strengthening overall network security posture.

**Key Features**

Advanced Packet Disassembly: Accurate Cyber Defense can break down network packets at a granular level, revealing detailed protocol structures, headers, payloads, and meta-information for each captured packet.

Hexadecimal Visualization: Provides a built-in hexadecimal viewer that allows users to analyze packet contents in their raw byte form. This feature is essential for spotting hidden data, malformed headers, and potential exploit payloads.

Live Packet Capture: Capture and monitor live network traffic in real-time, enabling immediate analysis of inbound and outbound traffic across multiple interfaces.

Customizable Filters: Use dynamic filters to isolate specific packet types, IP addresses, protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP), or suspicious behaviors for focused inspection.

Protocol Support: Supports a wide range of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP, ARP, and more. Each protocol is decoded and analyzed with protocol-specific logic for accurate interpretation.

Penetration Testing Integration: Seamlessly integrates with penetration testing workflows to identify vulnerabilities, unencrypted data, and anomalies within the network.

Data Export & Reports: Export packet data in various formats (PCAP, JSON, CSV) for further processing or documentation. Auto-generate reports summarizing threats, patterns, or security gaps.

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive interface with clear visualizations, color-coded packet types, and easy navigation for both beginners and advanced users.

Cross-Platform Support: Available on major operating systems including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
